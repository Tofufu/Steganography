This is a simple message encoding/decoding MATLAB program I made.
Doesn't have Huffman Encoding or a header with information, etc. Just takes in a message stream. Really basic only changing LSB.

main.m: Runs dLSB/eLSB
dLSB.m: Decoder function
eLSB.m: Encoder function

decodelsb.m: rough draft/detailed comments
lsb.m: rough draft/detailed comments
